TATA Retail Store Sales Analysis – Executive Summary Project Overview
A comprehensive sales and returns analysis of two years of transaction data for Tata Retail Stores. The aim: identify growth opportunities, reduce operational costs from returns, and inform data-driven business strategy.
Business Goal (SMART)
Specific: Reduce product return value and grow sales in international (non-UK) markets through improved product quality and targeted marketing.
Measurable: Achieve a 15% reduction in return value and a 10% increase in non-UK sales within 12 months.
Achievable: Focus on top-return products, optimize processes, and expand marketing to high-potential markets.
Relevant: Supports business growth and cost efficiency.
Time-bound: Deliver results by end of next fiscal year.
Analytics Process (OSEMN)
Obtain: Gathered retail transaction logs (CSV/Excel).
Scrub: Cleaned data, handled duplicates/missing values, flagged sales and returns.
Explore: Visualized sales, returns, order distributions, top products and countries.
Model: Applied aggregation, segmentation, and ranking; dashboard built in Tableau.
Interpret: Delivered actionable insights tied to business objectives.
Key Insights & Findings
Sales Concentration: UK generates the bulk of revenue and returns. Heavy market dependency.
International Opportunity: EIRE, Germany, France are top non-UK markets, but under-penetrated.
Product Dynamics: A few products drive most sales and returns (“PAPER CRAFT, LITTLE BIRDIE” is both top-selling and top-returned).
Order Behavior: Most orders are small and retail in nature, but high-value transactions (outliers) could signal VIP clients or fraud risk.
Returns Patterns: Large spikes in returns correspond to specific periods or products—warrant deeper investigation.
Business Recommendations
Market Diversification: Invest in targeted marketing to grow sales outside the UK, reducing market risk.
Product Quality Control: Audit high-return products to reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction.
Process Optimization: Investigate non-product (administrative) returns for possible process improvements.
Cross-Selling & Upselling: Use data on top-selling products to create targeted offers and bundles.
Impact
Supports a data-driven roadmap for international growth and reduced operational losses.
Tableau dashboard provides ongoing, real-time decision support to stakeholders.
Tools Used
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
Tableau (dashboarding, interactive visuals)
